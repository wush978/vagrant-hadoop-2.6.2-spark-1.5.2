vagrant-hadoop-2.6.2-spark-1.5.2
================================

# Introduction

Vagrant project to spin up a cluster of 4 virtual machines with Hadoop v2.6.2 and Spark v1.5.2

1. node1 : HDFS NameNode + Spark Master
2. node2 : YARN ResourceManager + JobHistoryServer + ProxyServer
3. node3 : HDFS DataNode + YARN NodeManager + Spark Slave
4. node4 : HDFS DataNode + YARN NodeManager + Spark Slave

# Getting Started

1. [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Download and install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
3. Run ```vagrant box add centos65 https://github.com/2creatives/vagrant-centos/releases/download/v6.5.1/centos65-x86_64-20131205.box```
4. Git clone this project, and change directory (cd) into this project (directory).
5. Run ```vagrant up``` to create the VM.
6. Run ```vagrant ssh``` to get into your VM.
7. Run ```vagrant destroy``` when you want to destroy and get rid of the VM.

Some gotcha's.

1. Make sure you download Vagrant v1.4.3 or higher.
2. Make sure when you clone this project, you preserve the Unix/OSX end-of-line (EOL) characters. The scripts will fail with Windows EOL characters.
3. Make sure you have 4Gb of free memory for the VM. You may change the Vagrantfile to specify smaller memory requirements.
4. This project has NOT been tested with the VMWare provider for Vagrant.
5. You may change the script (common.sh) to point to a different location for Hadoop and Spark to be downloaded from. Here is a list of mirrors for Hadoop: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/.

# Advanced Stuff

If you have the resources (CPU + Disk Space + Memory), you may modify Vagrantfile to have even more HDFS DataNodes, YARN NodeManagers, and Spark slaves. Just find the line that says "numNodes = 4" in Vagrantfile and increase that number. The scripts should dynamically provision the additional slaves for you.

# Make the VMs setup faster
You can make the VM setup even faster if you pre-download the Hadoop, Spark, and Oracle JDK into the /resources directory.

1. /resources/hadoop-2.6.2.tar.gz
2. /resources/spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz
3. /resources/jdk-7u51-linux-x64.gz

The setup script will automatically detect if these files (with precisely the same names) exist and use them instead. If you are using slightly different versions, you will have to modify the script accordingly.

# Make sure YARN and Spark jobs can run
I typically run the following tests after post-provisioning on node1 (as root user). 

### Test YARN
Run the following command to make sure you can run a MapReduce job.

```
yarn jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.6.2.jar pi 2 100
```

### Test Spark on YARN
You can test if Spark can run on YARN by issuing the following command. Try NOT to run this command on the slave nodes.

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
    --master yarn \
    --num-executors 10 \
    --executor-cores 2 \
    $SPARK_HOME/lib/spark-examples*.jar \
    100
```

### Test code directly on Spark	
```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
    --master spark://node1:7077 \
    --num-executors 10 \
    --executor-cores 2 \
    $SPARK_HOME/lib/spark-examples*.jar \
    100
```
	
### Test Spark using Shell
Start the Spark shell using the following command. Try NOT to run this command on the slave nodes.

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --master spark://node1:7077
```

Then go here https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html to start the tutorial. Most likely, you will have to load data into HDFS to make the tutorial work (Spark cannot read data on the local file system).

You might also want to dive into the learn-scala folder as that is a companion Scala project to learn Spark.

# Web UI
You can check the following URLs to monitor the Hadoop daemons.

1. [NameNode] (http://10.211.55.101:50070/dfshealth.html)
2. [ResourceManager] (http://10.211.55.102:8088/cluster)
3. [JobHistory] (http://10.211.55.102:19888/jobhistory)
4. [Spark] (http://10.211.55.101:8080)
5. [Spark History] (http://10.211.55.101:18080)

# Vagrant boxes
A list of available Vagrant boxes is shown at http://www.vagrantbox.es. 

# Vagrant box location
The Vagrant box is downloaded to the ~/.vagrant.d/boxes directory. On Windows, this is C:/Users/{your-username}/.vagrant.d/boxes.
